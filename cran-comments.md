* NOTE: Possibly misspelled word "codebook" in DESCRIPTION.  
  "Codebook" is an intended technical term referring to variable metadata and
  survey documentation.

## Comments

This is version 0.3.0 of the **spicy** package â€” a minor feature release
following version 0.2.1.

### New functionality

* Added `code_book()`, which generates an interactive and exportable variable
  codebook for data frames.
  - Builds on `varlist()` to summarize variable names, labels, types, and
    representative values.
  - Displays results as an interactive `DT::datatable()` with built-in search,
    sorting, and export options (copy, print, CSV, Excel, PDF).
  - Designed to support exploratory data inspection and improved dataset
    documentation workflows.

### Other improvements

* Minor documentation updates and internal consistency enhancements.
* No breaking changes or modifications to existing APIs.
* No changes to package dependencies.

### Testing environments

R CMD check passes cleanly on:

- Local macOS (R 4.4.1)
- Win-builder (devel, release, oldrelease)
- rhub (Windows, macOS, Ubuntu release)
