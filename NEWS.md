# spicy 0.5.0

* New `table_apa()` helper to build APA-ready cross-tab reports with multiple output formats (`wide`, `long`, `tinytable`, `flextable`, `excel`, `clipboard`, `word`).
* `table_apa()` exposes key `cross_tab()` controls for weighting and inference (`weights`, `rescale`, `correct`, `simulate_p`, `simulate_B`) and now handles missing values explicitly when `drop_na = FALSE`.


# spicy 0.4.2

* `cross_tab()` hardening: improved vector-mode detection (including labelled vectors), stricter weight validation, safer rescaling, and clearer early errors (e.g., explicit `y = NULL`).
* `cross_tab()` statistics are now computed on non-empty margins in grouped tables, avoiding spurious `NA` results; internal core path refactored to remove `dplyr`/`tibble` from computation while preserving user-facing behavior.
* `freq()` now errors clearly when `x` is missing for data.frame input and validates rescaling when weight sums are zero/non-finite.
* `count_n()`, `mean_n()`, and `sum_n()` regex mode is hardened (`regex = TRUE` now validates/defaults `select` safely).
* `mean_n()` and `sum_n()` now return `NA` (with warning) when no numeric columns are selected.
* `label_from_names()` now validates input type (`data.frame`/tibble required).
* `cramer_v()` now returns `NA` with warning for degenerate tables.
* Dependency optimization: `DT` and `clipr` moved to `Suggests`; optional runtime checks added in `code_book()` and `copy_clipboard()`.
* Tests expanded with regression coverage for all the above edge cases.


# spicy 0.4.1

* Fixed CRAN incoming check notes by removing non-standard top-level files.

# spicy 0.4.0

* `print.spicy()` has been fully redesigned to produce clean, aligned ASCII
  tables inspired by Stata's layout. The new implementation improves formatting,
  adds optional color support, and provides more consistent handling of totals
  and column spacing.

* Output from `freq()` and `cross_tab()` now benefits from the enhanced
  `print.spicy()` formatting, offering clearer, more readable summary tables.

* Documentation and internal tests were updated for clarity and consistency.

* `cross_tab()` gains an explicit `correct` argument to control the use of
  Yates' continuity correction for Chi-squared tests in 2x2 tables. The default
  behavior remains unchanged.

* The documentation of `cross_tab()` was refined and harmonized, with a clearer
  high-level description, improved parameter wording, and expanded examples.

* Minor cosmetic improvements were made to `varlist()` output: the title prefix
  now uses `vl:` instead of `VARLIST`, and the column name `Ndist_val` was renamed
  to `N_distinct` for improved readability and consistency.

* Minor cosmetic improvement: ASCII table output no longer includes a closing
  bottom rule by default.


# spicy 0.3.0

* New function `code_book()`, which generates a comprehensive variable
  codebook that can be viewed interactively and exported to multiple
  formats (copy, print, CSV, Excel, PDF).

# spicy 0.2.1

* `label_from_names()` now correctly handles edge cases when the
  separator appears in the label or is missing.

# spicy 0.2.0

* New function `label_from_names()` to derive and assign variable labels
  from headers of the form `"name<sep>label"` (e.g. `"name. label"`).
  Especially useful for LimeSurvey CSV exports (*Export results* ->
  *CSV* -> *Headings: Question code & question text*), where the default
  separator is `". "`.

# spicy 0.1.0

## Initial release

* Introduces a collection of tools for variable inspection, descriptive
  summaries, and data exploration.
* Provides functions to:
  - Extract variable metadata and display compact summaries (`varlist()`).
  - Compute frequency tables (`freq()`), cross-tabulations (`cross_tab()`),
    and Cramer's V for categorical associations (`cramer_v()`).
  - Generate descriptive statistics such as means (`mean_n()`), sums
    (`sum_n()`), and counts (`count_n()`) with automatic handling of
    missing data.
  - Copy data (`copy_clipboard()`) directly to the clipboard for quick export.
