spicy is designed to make variable exploration and descriptive statistics fast, expressive, and easy to use.


## What is spicy?

spicy is an R package for quick, consistent, and elegant exploration of data frames. It helps you:

- Extract variable metadata and display compact summaries of dataset variables using `varlist()` (with `vl()` as a convenient shortcut), including names, labels, values, classes, number of distinct non-missing values,  number of valid observations, number of missing observations. Similar to the "Variable View" in SPSS or the "Variables Manager" in Stata.
- Compute frequency tables with `freq()`, row-wise means with `mean_n()`, row-wise sums with `sum_n()`, and counts of specific values using `count_n()` — all with automatic handling of missing data.
- Explore relationships between categorical variables using `cross_tab()` for contingency tables and `cramer_v()` for association strength.
- Copy data frames or result tables directly to the clipboard using `copy_clipboard()` for fast export to spreadsheets or text editors.
- Extract and assign variable labels from column headers with label_from_names(), especially useful for LimeSurvey CSV exports where headers follow a "name [separator] label" pattern — any string can be used as the separator (e.g., ". ", " - ", ":", etc.).
- Handle `labelled`, `factor`, `Date`, `POSIXct`, and other commonly used variable types.  

All with intuitive functions that return clean, structured outputs.

## Installation

For the stable version, install from CRAN.
```r
install.packages("spicy")
```

You can install the development version of spicy from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("amaltawfik/spicy")
```

---

## Example usage

Here are some quick examples using built-in datasets:
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(spicy)
library(dplyr)

# Get a summary of all variables in the Viewer
varlist(iris)
```
<img src="man/figures/varlist_1.png" alt="Summary of all variables shown in the Viewer">

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Get a summary of the variables that start with "d" in the Viewer
# Asterisks (*) in the title indicate that the data frame has been subsetted
vl(mtcars, starts_with("d"))
```
<img src="man/figures/varlist_2.png" alt="Summary of the variables that start with d in the Viewer">

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(spicy)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r eval=TRUE}
# Get a summary of all variables as a tibble
varlist(iris, tbl = TRUE)

# Tabulate frequencies with sort alphabetically (Z-A)
freq(iris, Species, sort = "name-")

# Cross-tab with column percentages
cross_tab(mtcars, cyl, gear)

# Cross-tab with row percentages
cross_tab(mtcars, cyl, gear, rowprct = TRUE)

# Cross-tab with column percentages grouped by a single variable
cross_tab(mtcars, cyl, gear, by = am)

# Compute row-wise mean/sum (all values must be valid by default) or specific value
df <- data.frame(
  var1 = c(10, NA, 30, 40, 50),
  var2 = c(5, NA, 15, NA, 25),
  var3 = c(NA, 30, 20, 50, 10)
)
df
mean_n(df)
sum_n(df)
count_n(df, count = 10)
count_n(df, special = "NA")
df |> mutate(count30 = count_n(count = 30))

# Extract labels from column names like "varname. label"
# This format ("name. label") is the default in LimeSurvey CSV exports
# when using: Export results → Export format: CSV → Headings: Question code & question text.
# It uses ". " (dot + space) as the default separator between the question code and question text.
df <- tibble::tibble(
  "age. Age of respondent" = c(25, 30),
  "score. Total score. Manually computed." = c(12, 14)
)

out <- label_from_names(df)

# View assigned labels
labelled::var_label(out)
```

> All functions can be directly used in pipelines.
