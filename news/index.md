## spicy 0.4.1

## spicy 0.4.0 (in development)

- `print.spicy()` has been fully redesigned to produce clean, aligned
  ASCII tables inspired by Stata’s layout. The new implementation
  improves formatting, adds optional color support, and provides more
  consistent handling of totals and column spacing.

- Output from
  [`freq()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/freq.md) and
  [`cross_tab()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/cross_tab.md)
  now benefits from the enhanced `print.spicy()` formatting, offering
  clearer, more readable summary tables.

- Documentation and internal tests were updated for clarity and
  consistency.

## spicy 0.3.0

CRAN release: 2025-10-22

- New function
  [`code_book()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/code_book.md),
  which generates a comprehensive variable codebook that can be viewed
  interactively and exported to multiple formats (copy, print, CSV,
  Excel, PDF).

## spicy 0.2.1

CRAN release: 2025-10-04

- [`label_from_names()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/label_from_names.md)
  now correctly handles edge cases when the separator appears in the
  label or is missing.

## spicy 0.2.0

CRAN release: 2025-09-25

- New function
  [`label_from_names()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/label_from_names.md)
  to derive and assign variable labels from headers of the form
  `"name<sep>label"` (e.g. `"name. label"`). Especially useful for
  LimeSurvey CSV exports (*Export results* → *CSV* → *Headings: Question
  code & question text*), where the default separator is `". "`.
