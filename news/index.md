# Changelog

## spicy 0.4.1

- Fixed CRAN incoming check notes by removing non-standard top-level
  files.

## spicy 0.4.0

- `print.spicy()` has been fully redesigned to produce clean, aligned
  ASCII tables inspired by Stata’s layout. The new implementation
  improves formatting, adds optional color support, and provides more
  consistent handling of totals and column spacing.

- Output from
  [`freq()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/freq.md) and
  [`cross_tab()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/cross_tab.md)
  now benefits from the enhanced `print.spicy()` formatting, offering
  clearer, more readable summary tables.

- Documentation and internal tests were updated for clarity and
  consistency.

- [`cross_tab()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/cross_tab.md)
  gains an explicit `correct` argument to control the use of Yates’
  continuity correction for Chi-squared tests in 2x2 tables. The default
  behavior remains unchanged.

- The documentation of
  [`cross_tab()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/cross_tab.md)
  was refined and harmonized, with a clearer high-level description,
  improved parameter wording, and expanded examples.

- Minor cosmetic improvements were made to
  [`varlist()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/varlist.md)
  output: the title prefix now uses `vl:` instead of `VARLIST`, and the
  column name `Ndist_val` was renamed to `N_distinct` for improved
  readability and consistency.

- Minor cosmetic improvement: ASCII table output no longer includes a
  closing bottom rule by default.

## spicy 0.3.0

CRAN release: 2025-10-22

- New function
  [`code_book()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/code_book.md),
  which generates a comprehensive variable codebook that can be viewed
  interactively and exported to multiple formats (copy, print, CSV,
  Excel, PDF).

## spicy 0.2.1

CRAN release: 2025-10-04

- [`label_from_names()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/label_from_names.md)
  now correctly handles edge cases when the separator appears in the
  label or is missing.

## spicy 0.2.0

CRAN release: 2025-09-25

- New function
  [`label_from_names()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/label_from_names.md)
  to derive and assign variable labels from headers of the form
  `"name<sep>label"` (e.g. `"name. label"`). Especially useful for
  LimeSurvey CSV exports (*Export results* → *CSV* → *Headings: Question
  code & question text*), where the default separator is `". "`.

## spicy 0.1.0

    ([`varlist()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/varlist.md)).
  - Compute frequency tables
    ([`freq()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/freq.md)),
    cross-tabulations
    ([`cross_tab()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/cross_tab.md)),
    and Cramer’s V for categorical associations
    ([`cramer_v()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/cramer_v.md)).
  - Generate descriptive statistics such as means
    ([`mean_n()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/mean_n.md)),
    sums
    ([`sum_n()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/sum_n.md)),
    and counts
    ([`count_n()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/count_n.md))
    with automatic handling of missing data.
  - Copy data
    ([`copy_clipboard()`](https://amaltawfik.github.io/spicy/reference/copy_clipboard.md))
    directly to the clipboard for quick export.
